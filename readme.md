This is a data visualization tool in progress that shows which online literary journals award-winning poems and short stories were published in. The data was aggregated by Kevin Dublin and sourced from Sundress Publications' annual Best of the Net Anthology. Future data added will come from the Best American Poetry & Best American Short Stories, Best New Poets, and Pushcart Prize.
